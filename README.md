# Dress in Place
*I don't have a better name for it! Woops!*

This is my project for Stanford University's Code in Place.

I really badly wanted to learn Python because I heard it's weirdly good for game dev, so I took the course.

## About the project
It's a dress-up game where you customize a poorly-drawn anime girl.

This is a proof-of-concept alpha, and I would like to expand on it in the future.

But making assets takes time... So I'll have to put that in my schedule.

# Credits
All visual assets were hand-drawn save for the sidebar, thanks to Texture Labs for the torn paper graphic. (You know that stereotype where school-based games love using paper-themed UI elements? Yup.)

## Future goals
I want to make the UI nicer with buttons (kind of like The Sims 4), and also add a bit of a "story mode" to it.

Thank you! I hope you enjoy my humble project! :)
